Construct's Armory is an add-on mod for Tinkers' Construct that adds four armor items: Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, and
Boots. These armor types can be customized just like the tools from Tinkers' Construct, allowing you to make different
armor parts out of different materials in order to form a completely custom armor item.
